# "Landing Page" for The Odin Project

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

## Notes [10/08/2022]:

- Similar to Recipes [https://github.com/roznerx/recipes], this is a brand new project in *The Odin Project* curriculum, added only a couple of weeks ago. So, I'll copy-paste what I said about this "old-new" projects before: *I was already deep into the *Fullstack Javascript* path when the new changes were added, so I decided to go back and complete the new projects and lessons in order to learn more information about the basics. Due to the fact that I don't want to keep stalling with the fullstack path, this new projects won't have the same dedication as the more advanced ones... Although I can't promise anything due to my "perfectionist" OCD ;)*
